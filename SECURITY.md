You can import a key by running the following command with that
individualâ€™s fingerprint: `gpg --recv-keys "<fingerprint>"`
Ensure that you put quotes around fingerprints containing spaces.

These public keys can also be found in the Electrum-grs git repository,
in the top-level `pubkeys` folder.
