### Electrum-GRS - lightweight multi-coin client
Electrum-GRS provides a basic SPV wallet for GRSpay. It is a BIP-0044-compliant wallet based on the original Electrum for Bitcoin. This Electrum-GRS client uses Electrum servers to retrieve necessary blockchain headaer & transaction data, so no "Electrum-GRS server" is necessary.

Because of the Simplified Payment Verification nature of the wallet, services requiring Masternode communications, such as DarkSend and InstantX are not available.
